# ADR 0041: FE-local capsules on Windows (Ship's Log P3)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-25). The contract for running voyage-recording
capsules on the Windows frontend machines, so the frontend's Terminal-drawer
session survives frontend restarts. Implements the ADR 0037 ladder's P3.

## Scope, in one paragraph

P3 makes the Windows frontend's drawer session a voyage-recorded,
capsule-held process that survives FE restarts, and thereby retires the
RESUME RITUAL — ADR 0017 §4's `resume_command`, `claude --continue`, and
the session-start re-arm dance. On an FE relaunch the FE attaches and runs
NOTHING; an optional `initial_command` (which replaces the
`resume_command` setting) fires only when a genuinely new capsule spawns
the shell, independent of `--relaunched`. Explicitly NOT in P3: the
relaunch mechanism itself (ADR 0017 §1–§3 stays); the fe-inbox
down-window (the FE process remains the inbox writer — relay traffic
during a respawn is still dropped; stated, not fixed); the Claude SDK
adapter on Windows (the drawer is recorded as a RAW TERMINAL voyage);
named jobs / a `winjob-fence-v1` feature / probe-successors; ReFS (local
NTFS only until ReFS passes the same suite); any change to the merged
Linux capsule path (the new socket module is platform-neutral code, wired
only on Windows in P3); Sessions-mode rows for FE voyages; the catalog;
remote attach (P4).

## The store port (fsutil's Windows arm)

- **Volume preflight** (NTFS, local, via `GetVolumeInformationByHandleW`
  on the parent directory) runs BEFORE any `.creating` mutation in
  bootstrap, and again on the resolved voyage dir at `open_for_writing`.
  SMB failing the call is usefully fail-closed; no fallback. This is the
  Windows mirror of "requires renameat2".
- **Publication order, pinned at every site** (segment seal, recovery,
  blob, bootstrap dir rename): source-file flush → no-replace rename
  (`MoveFileExW` flags 0 — one kernel op, no TOCTOU; bounded retry on
  `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` and spurious `ACCESS_DENIED` from AV/indexer
  holders, a transient with no Linux analog; a persistent holder still
  fails at the deadline) → renamed-file flush (belt-and-braces: covers
  the doc-implied corner of the directory-flush contract) →
  parent-directory flush (`FlushFileBuffers` on a
  `GENERIC_WRITE + FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` directory handle). NTFS
  metadata journaling gives crash CONSISTENCY, not durability-at-return —
  the directory flush is required, and is strictly stronger than what
  SQLite, RocksDB, and PostgreSQL ship on Windows.
- **writer.lock**: open-existing only — never silently recreate a missing
  persistent fence; opened WITHOUT `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` (std shares
  delete/rename by default) so the locked path cannot be replaced to mint
  a second fence. The lock itself is `File::try_lock` (Rust ≥ 1.89 —
  `LockFileEx(EXCLUSIVE|FAIL_IMMEDIATELY)` on Windows, `flock` on Unix;
  both platform arms collapse into one std call), keeping the existing
  250 ms bounded retry (OS lock release after a hard kill has a
  documented timing transient).
- **Randomness**: both `/dev/urandom` sites (blob temp nonce, capsule
  idem keys) move to the `getrandom` crate — deletes a unix-ism.
- **Format invariance**: the byte-based tear classifier, goldens, and
  torn-tail semantics are platform-independent; CI proves goldens
  byte-identical across OSes.
- **Operational note**: the per-disk "turn off write-cache buffer
  flushing" checkbox makes `FlushFileBuffers` silently vacuous —
  undetectable from the application, the peer of Linux `barrier=off`,
  acceptable only on a UPS.

## Containment and the owned ConPTY layer

The capsule owns its small Windows spawn layer via `windows-sys` (the
same raw-API altitude the Linux side uses for `pre_exec`):
`CreatePseudoConsole` → a TWO-attribute `STARTUPINFOEXW`
(`PSEUDOCONSOLE` + `JOB_LIST`) → `CreateProcessW`. `portable-pty` is
deliberately not used for the spawn — its ConPTY path installs exactly
one attribute and exposes no job hook, so atomic containment is
impossible through it. The job is ANONYMOUS with
`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` and no breakaway flags: capsule
death — however it dies — makes the kernel terminate the whole in-job
tree (the lease and the kill are one mechanism on Windows). "Reaps the
tree" is scoped to in-job descendants; broker-mediated spawning (WMI,
COM activation, schtasks, services) is outside the domain — the verbatim
analog of the Linux external-supervisor carve-out. NO `kill_domain` is
recorded: absence claims no authority (verifier-legal under the
locator-must-declare rule); the anonymous job and any outer-job coupling
are recorded as non-authority spawn-detail diagnostics.

- **Partial-spawn unwind, pinned**: each acquired resource (job, pipe
  server, pseudoconsole, attribute list, process, pump thread) unwinds
  in reverse on failure. A committed `producer_spawn` followed by
  `CreateProcessW` failure records `producer_dead {spawn_failed}` and
  seals — the voyage stays verify-green.
- **Termination sequence, one implementation**: revoke input →
  `TerminateJobObject` → poll `ActiveProcesses == 0` while draining
  output → call `ClosePseudoConsole` WITH THE READER STILL RUNNING
  (pre-24H2 Windows documents that the close can block forever unless
  output is concurrently drained); the reader drains THROUGH the close
  to EOF and is joined only after EOF — join-before-close is an
  implementation error, pinned here. Then commit final output →
  `producer_dead` → seal. "Drain" never means waiting for an interactive
  shell to exit on its own.
- **Breakaway-denied** (a jobbed launcher, e.g. an SSH session): startup
  proceeds with survival marked DEGRADED — recorded in spawn detail and
  surfaced to the FE ("session will not survive launcher death") — and
  the lifecycle rows conditional on it. No broker workaround in P3.

## Terminal state: the capsule is the rendering authority

- Attach delivers an EXACT STRUCTURED CHECKPOINT of the parser state.
  The vt100 fork this project owns gains checkpoint/restore covering
  both grids, alternate-screen identity, current and saved cursor, and
  origin/wrap/input modes — NO scrollback. Checkpoint completeness is a
  TESTED property (alternate-screen and saved-cursor roundtrip tests).
  `contents_formatted`-style reconstruction is explicitly not used — it
  does not encode the inactive grid or alternate-screen identity.
- The capsule keeps NO scrollback: scrollback is FE-side derived state
  accumulated from the live stream after attach; pre-attach history
  waits for frame replay (P4) — the voyage already records every byte.
  This deletion is what makes the resource budget provable.
- The ConPTY DSR responder runs from producer spawn with zero clients
  attached, with parser CARRY state across chunk boundaries (the
  frontend's current "queries don't straddle chunks" shortcut is not a
  protocol guarantee).
- Resize and DSR use request → act → outcome (the existing
  `control_exchange` phases): the request commits before the action, the
  outcome (success/failure) commits after, persisted geometry updates
  only on success, and the DSR reply frame `responds_to` its request —
  replay can distinguish "requested" from "performed".
- **The resource budget** (one table; arithmetic closes; a serializer
  test at max dimensions proves the snapshot bound):

  | resource            | bound                                        |
  |---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
  | max cols × rows     | 512 × 256                                    |
  | cell size (fork)    | 32 B → one grid ≤ 4 MiB, two ≤ 8 MiB         |
  | checkpoint bound    | ≤ 2 grids + fixed header < 12 MiB, proven    |
  | snapshot transport  | chunked in ≤ 1 MiB frames (per-op cap holds) |
  | per-op message cap  | 1 MiB                                        |
  | producer channel    | 8 MiB bounded — when full the writer loop    |
  |                     | stops POLLING output (backpressure lands in  |
  |                     | ConPTY); control/liveness always serviced    |
  | per-watcher queue   | 4 MiB, overflow = eviction                   |
  | driver queue        | 4 MiB; committed driver-visible bytes are    |
  |                     | never dropped while the connection is live,  |
  |                     | but transport liveness is bounded (missed    |
  |                     | keepalive → disconnect; the bytes remain in  |
  |                     | the voyage) — a hung driver cannot wedge the |
  |                     | writer loop                                  |

## The attach protocol

One local socket per voyage (a named pipe on Windows), created
`FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE`, rejecting remote clients, all handles
non-inheritable. **Security split**: the persistent voyage TREE gets a
DACL for the stable account SID (token user — logon SIDs differ per
logon session and would strand voyages at reboot), installed ATOMICALLY
at `.creating` creation via security attributes (never
create-then-repair), with `SE_DACL_PROTECTED` set and owner ACEs marked
inheritable — a permissive parent directory cannot inject ACEs into the
tree. The ephemeral pipe uses the account SID too. The threat model is
other local users and anonymous access, not the owner.

There is no `detach` op — ordered pipe EOF is detach, clean or crash.

- **mgmt lane** (PERMANENTLY PINNED v0 framing, never versioned):
  `probe` / `status` / `shutdown`. `status` replies carry the capsule's
  self-reported pid and process creation time.
- **attach lane** (versioned via hello):
  - `hello {proto_version}` — both directions.
  - `attach {controller_id}` — arrives as a WATCHER, always (a frontend
    relaunch is precisely a reconnect, and reconnects arrive as
    watchers — ADR 0037's who-may-type).
  - `take {controller_id}` — a committed take-epoch transition with an
    acknowledgment barrier; installs an EPHEMERAL DRIVER CAPABILITY
    bound to THIS pipe connection (EOF clears it). The forward check
    requires the capability AND the durable holder/epoch — replaying
    identity fields without a `take` cannot type.
  - `input {controller_id, take_epoch, idem_key, bytes}` — the ack means
    exactly "input recorded"; duplicate `idem_key`s get deterministic
    answers; size-capped; the stale-epoch recheck happens immediately
    before the PTY write, and a stale refusal emits the WAL lattice's
    `{input, refused_stale_epoch}` fact — never a bare input frame
    (bare means must-retry) — with verifier-valid attribution (the
    envelope carries the committed epoch; staleness lives in the fact).
  - `resize {cols, rows}` — driver-only.

ALL ops enter the ONE ordered writer loop. Attach is serviced by that
loop with a WATERMARK BARRIER: force the pending output group-commit,
then establish checkpoint and subscription at that single watermark — a
snapshot can never show bytes the voyage could still lose.

## Lifecycle: one rule, one transition, one probe algorithm

ONE spawn owner — the supervisor (the launcher loop that already
outlives FE respawns and keeps the ssh tunnel). The FE is attach-only.

**The rule: only an explicit FE exit 0 ends the run.** Exit 75, nonzero
exits, FE crashes, supervisor death — all are FE loss; the capsule is
untouched.

**The transition: `EndRun(reason)`** is the only teardown
implementation, invoked by FE real quit, the machine-cleanup script, and
incompatible-upgrade end-run. EndRun = mgmt `shutdown` → the capsule
acks, drains, seals, exits. Proof of completion is capsule ack + pipe
closure + verify-green + lock release — never `WaitForExit` (an
adopting supervisor has no child handle). A raw-terminal EndRun writes
`producer_dead` + seal only — raw terminals emit no turns, so there are
no synthesized closes.

**The probe algorithm** — supervisor start is a pinned state table on
(pipe, writer.lock):

- pipe live + lock held → ADOPT (never touch the lock). Adoption
  captures TERMINATION AUTHORITY with a post-open liveness challenge
  that closes the pid-reuse race: (1) read the server pid P via
  `GetNamedPipeServerProcessId` on the live connection; (2)
  `OpenProcess(P, PROCESS_TERMINATE | PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION
  | SYNCHRONIZE)`; (3) AFTER the open, issue a mgmt `status` challenge
  on the same connection — the reply carries the capsule's self-reported
  pid and creation time; (4) the handle is proven to be the server iff
  reply-pid == P AND reply creation time == `GetProcessTimes(handle)`.
  (A dead true server cannot answer the challenge; a live one means P is
  not recycled — pids are unique among live processes.) The (handle,
  creation-time) pair is the pinned identity; SYNCHRONIZE makes the
  post-termination wait executable.
- pipe absent + lock held → bounded retry → visible wedge error. Never
  spawn over it.
- pipe absent + lock free → release the probe lock, spawn, RE-PROBE to
  converge — two racing supervisors resolve with the loser converging on
  the winner, never a false fatal.
- pipe live + lock free, or identity mismatch → inconsistent: loud stop.

## Upgrade and version skew

`probe`/`status`/`shutdown` ride the pinned v0 mgmt framing — the
permanently compatible lane; attach-protocol versions negotiate via
`hello` above it. The staged capsule binary is replaced only after
EndRun completes (stage-after-exit) — a running capsule is never
overwritten in place; an FE upgrade mid-run keeps the old capsule and
offers end-run via the mgmt lane. If a security defect invalidates even
the mgmt lane, the honest fallback is hard termination + voyage
recovery, executable because adoption captured a termination-capable
handle bound to the live pipe server by the liveness challenge
(re-verified unchanged immediately before `TerminateProcess`, then a
BOUNDED `WaitForSingleObject` on the same handle — termination is
asynchronous and can await pending I/O; a timeout is a LOUD failure,
never an assumed death). Graceful shutdown is not promised
unconditionally. The release pipeline packages the capsule binary.

## Build order (each step lands green)

1. Promote the state-dir helper into a shared frontend `paths.rs`
   (three divergent copies exist today).
2. The store port: Windows fsutil + getrandom + volume preflight;
   UNGATE the deterministic suites on Windows (the reconciliation
   matrix, goldens, and verifier tests are compiled out by `cfg(unix)`
   today) + a `TerminateProcess` fault sweep as the kill-sweep analog;
   goldens byte-identical in CI.
3. vt100 fork checkpoint/restore, roundtrip-tested (prerequisite for 5).
4. Capsule ConPTY flavor: owned spawn + unwind ordering + job
   containment + DSR carry + request/outcome resize + the budget table.
5. The pipe protocol (mgmt v0 + attach lane) through the ordered writer
   loop; watermark attach; connection-scoped pen.
6. Supervisor probe/adopt/EndRun + FE attach-only backend +
   `initial_command` + packaging + machine-cleanup orphan stop.
7. Acceptance on a real Windows machine, the full matrix: exit-75
   relaunch reattaches with screen restored and no ritual; FE hard
   crash; supervisor hard death then adoption; capsule hard kill →
   `ActiveProcesses == 0` → recovery → a visible "run ended — new leg"
   UX (never a silent blank swap); graceful quit → verify green; DSR
   answered before any client ever attaches; resize/reattach;
   stale-controller input refused per the lattice; slow-watcher
   eviction; hung-driver transport bounded; ACL denial for a second
   local user; logout/login and reboot ACL access; AV rename-retry;
   disk-full visible; forced-reboot recovery (the voyage survives: open
   tip recovered, all acknowledged input preserved, only a provable
   unpublished tail discarded, a new epoch, verify green); converging
   supervisor race; breakaway-denied degraded path; alternate-screen
   attach fidelity roundtrip.

## Consequences

- The drawer session stops dying with the frontend; the resume ritual —
  the single most fragile piece of the FE session lifecycle — is
  deleted rather than repaired.
- The store becomes genuinely cross-platform with equal guarantees,
  which P4 (bridge) and every later phase inherit for free.
- The Windows kill domain is SIMPLER than Linux's in the common crash
  path: the kernel reaps on capsule death with no successor act.
- The ADR 0037 ladder's platform ordering is corrected: Windows first;
  macOS remains a recorded sketch (process groups, everything
  best-effort) until a macOS machine exists to dogfood it.
