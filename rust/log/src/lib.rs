//! Ship's Log voyage store — frame codec + segment format.
//!
//! ADR 0039 is the normative contract; this crate implements it. The bytes
//! this crate writes are read forever, so behavior here favors refusing
//! loudly over guessing: only a *provably* torn tail is ever discarded, and
//! every other defect halts. Nothing is ever deleted (v1 has no GC, no
//! retention deletion, no forks, no packs — those return through the
//! `codec_id` / `required_features` / version seams).
