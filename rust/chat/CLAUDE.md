# rust/chat: chat (contract)

The project chat's policy. This stage holds one piece, normalization: Slack's raw message JSON into the wire's one
record (`sot_protocol::chat::ChatRecord`). The crate (`sot-chat`) depends on `sot-protocol`, `serde_json` and nothing
else; nothing links it but the workspace (`sotd` does not yet). It touches no network, owns no runtime state, and has
no Slack connection, no delivery and no channel mapping.

## Guarantees
1. **Every message shape gives a result, never a panic or a silent drop.** `normalize(ctx, channel, raw)` returns
   `New` (a message), `Edited` (a changed message under its original identity, so a caller can tell it from new work),
   `Deleted` (the identity to remove), `Unsupported` or `Unrepresentable` (not an object, a bad workspace, channel or
   timestamp, a wrong-typed `subtype` or edit body): the caller treats `Unrepresentable` as a gap. `Unsupported` is neither a gap nor a message: the
   subtype is not on the list of displayed ones (none, `thread_broadcast`, `file_share`, `bot_message`, `me_message`;
   joins, tombstones and any subtype Slack adds later), and the caller skips it and logs the raw subtype. A message with a valid `ts` whose other fields cannot be read becomes
   a record with `omitted` set and no content, not a dropped message; it keeps its author id, its origin (an own post or any message with a `bot_id` key, even an unreadable one, is `Bot`, never
   `Member`) and its thread, each read on its own; an unreadable `thread_ts` falls back to `ts`. Limit: the author's display name is the event's own
   profile name or empty; resolving a member's name needs the API, which is a later stage.
2. **Own posts are decided only by the supplied bot identity, and a forged marker never makes one.** Own-app is
   `Context.own_bot_id` or `own_user_id` matching the message; an identity not supplied matches nothing. Only an own
   post has its origin recovered, in order from `metadata`, then the `username` suffix ` (<kind> via Ship of Tools)`,
   giving `Drawer` (person) or `Row`. An own post with neither is `Bot` (display only), its text untouched, even when
   the text carries a marker. A member who types a marker, a forged `username` or `metadata` from anyone else, and
   another bot stay `Member` and `Bot`.
3. **A record is bounded, and a cut is marked.** 32 KiB of encoded JSON, 8 KiB of text, eight file summaries (the rest
   counted in `files_omitted`, as is any file entry with no valid id), 64 ASCII-byte ids, 160 / 256 / 128 bytes for an
   author name / filename / MIME. A cut falls on a character boundary and sets `truncated` (which covers text, names,
   filename and MIME); the record's size is held by halving the text until it fits, and once the text is gone the other bounds (ids, names, eight files, three timestamps) keep it near 8 KiB, far under the cap, so nothing else is cut. Names, filenames and MIME lose control characters and are trimmed of surrounding whitespace (`clean`), and nothing else is stripped: direction and other format characters stay, for the later display and mail rules. A
   file stub (`file_access: check_file_info`) keeps its id only. A private URL is never copied; a thumbnail is a flag.
   Limit: `truncated` does not say which field was cut.
4. **An attachment-only message is a record with empty text and its files.** Nothing needs a caption.

The timestamp rule (exactly `<seconds>.<six digits>`) is wire's `Ts`; this crate builds only `Ts` values, so a record
never holds another form.

## Owns
`normalize.rs`: `normalize`, `Context`, `Normalized`, `Unrepresentable` and the bound constants.

## Calls in
`sot_protocol::chat::{ChatRecord, ChatAuthor, ChatFile, Origin, Ts}`, `serde_json::Value`.

## Does not
Open a connection, hold a credential, call Slack, file mail, map channels to rows, or resolve a name. Define the
record's representation (wire's).

## Tests
Paths are under `rust/chat/src/`.
